# RubyMQ

Message-oriented middleware for Ruby, implementation of [AMQP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol) protocol and messaging application framework with store-and-forward messaging server.

Although it currently became obsolete, I left it here in the memory of my past efforts.
